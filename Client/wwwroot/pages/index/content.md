I am a fullstack developer in the .NET Tech Stack for web applications.

This website is a generic blog-ish site for managing current projects and thoughts.

Currently learning:

- Maintaining, consuming, and posting content to SQL databases hosted with Azure.

Currently working on:

- [IGP Fan Reference](https://www.igpfanreference.com/), a fan reference website for IMMORTAL: Gates of Pyre.

Killing time with:

- Playing and following updates to Legends of Runeterra.
- Watching a variety of e-sport tournaments on YouTube and Twitch.
- Lurking the IGP Discord and the LoR and PoE Reddits.

Best parts of a project:

- Collecting and adding customer feedback. It solidifies the goals of the work.
- Visual Things. Easy to see progress and try out new things.
- Finishing a product. Now people can use it.
- Writing documentation and examples. Useful for future reference and bringing people up to speed.

Least favorite:

- Configuring some required tools for the first time. It feels like hitting your head against a wall until it works.
- Research and development. Too many possible options. I want to get back to making progress as soon as possible.
- Security. What is required to get this working? Can I even be sure this is or will always be secure?
