Basically use it for all screenshots.

# Why Use Snagit?

It's hard to understand something without a picture. What are you talking about?
Am I on the right page? Am I missing something obvious? Please, give me more than text.
Give me a picture, and it just helps a lot.

And in my experience, a lot of people won't understand a picture unless you put
step numbers on it, yellow highlights, and a lot of arrows pointing at what they
need to look at.

(Perhaps I should be switching to videos for instructions, but given how overkill
that feels right now, text and pictures it is.)

So the ease of just hitting a hotkey to quickly take a screenshot of something
and pointing a variety of arrows of whatever I need someone to click on, is a quality
of life feature I wouldn't want to live without.

# My Snagit Best Practices

## Use symbols over text

You can't exactly localize or easily fix typos in a picture, so it's better to reference
text outside.

If needing to add complicated instructions, use step numbers in tne image, and indicate
the steps outside of the image in plain text.

1. Click **Capture** to take a screenshot
2. Click **More** and choose Step
3. Click the desired Step style
4. Click the screenshot to indicate the first step

## Don't make screenshots too big

It's just a bit cumbersome. I like to always make any window at least 50% of it's current size
before taking any screenshot of it.

Sure, you could just take a screenshot of the exact
part of the screen the viewer needs to look at, but I find that doesn't provide me
enough information. Like, where the button is on the page? And other quick context that gets lost
when not showing the full picture.

So here is a quick example of a screenshot I could make to indicate to someone where they should
start writing the markdown content. Simply blur the UI they don't need to focus on, and add
arrows if needed.
