I use C# with .NET 6 for all coding.

## Why Use C# with .NET 6?

Just mentally burnt out on using too many programming languages and frameworks at the same time.
Too many ways to do the same thing, and having to keep resetting knowledge to learn some new way of
doing the same thing in a less familiar way. So much wasted effort and time, so I am focusing on C# going forward.

I also have a bad habit of always using the latest and greatest, rather than the current Long Term Support version.
This habit often leads to getting into states where some part of my development stack doesn't work with
December 2022.

So currently using Blazor Webassembly frontend website, Blazor Server for servers. And I clearly need to get more up to
speed with this development stack since I spent too much time Peter Principling my self by working in too many different
tech stacks.

## Things to do

I haven't written any real console apps in C#. I have always used some other programming language.

I haven't written any real desktop tools in C#. Not since college.

I haven't written any real mobiles games in C#. Again, not since college.
